        This is a simplistic python script for downloading YouTube videos.
        It can be interacted with through it's built in UI, or entirely through terminal arguments.
        If the terminal arguments aren't present or raise an error, this script fallback to
        the UI for the unresolved parameters.
        
        In total, it uses three parameters; the {c.bold}{c.red}URL{c.reset} of the video,
        the {c.bold}{c.red}resolution{c.reset} of the video, and the {c.bold}{c.red}filename{c.reset} of the result.
        
        --------------------  Notes  ----------------------------------------
        You can modify a couple of settings within the actual script (VideoDownloader.py), at the top.
            The {c.bold}"TMP_File_Save_Location"{c.reset} is where this script will save the video-only and audio-only
        streams, before they're combined to make the output file.
            The Save_Location is where the final output files are saved.
        The {c.bold}Formatting{c.reset} variable can be set to either {c.bold}"True"{c.reset} or {c.bold}"False"{c.reset}.
            If set to false, the colored and otherwise formatted (i.e., shown in bold) text that appears when the script runs
        will be reverted to the non-formatted form. So, no ANSI escape codes.
        
        --------------------  Examples  ----------------------------------------
        For these, I'll be using one of CGP Grey's videos, titled "The Race to Win Staten Island"
        
        This one leads you through the parameters via the UI after you press enter.
            python VideoDownloader.py
        
        Here the URL is already entered, so it only asks via UI for the latter two.
            python VideoDownloader.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex74x_gqTU0
        
        You can shorten the URL quite a bit...
            python VideoDownloader.py v=Ex74x_gqTU0
        
        Pre-add more parameters!
            python VideoDownloader.py v=Ex74x_gqTU0 2160 The Race to Win Staten Island
        
        This one does the exact same thing
            python VideoDownloader.py v=Ex74x_gqTU0 max /title
        
        Or, (in general) if you want the highest res version that doesn't exceed a limit...
            python VideoDownloader.py v=Ex74x_gqTU0 max1440 /title
        
        Maybe you want to add a suffix, and a prefix?
            python VideoDownloader.py hello/titleworld
        
        It'll still work, you just have to put in the correct info (in this case, res) via UI
            python VideoDownloader.py v=Ex74x_gqTU0 552960 /title
        
        --------------------  Terminal  ----------------------------------------
        Via the terminal, you simply type in the parameters:
        {c.red}{'=' * 80}{c.reset}
        python    VideoDownloader.py    [URL]    [resolution]    [filename].
        {c.red}{'=' * 80}{c.reset}
        
        Note that you can type in "{c.bold}audio{c.reset}" (in place of the resolution) to
        download only the video's audio, as an audio file.
        
        Another note is that you can slightly automate the latter parameters; by typing in {c.bold}"max"{c.reset},
        this script will download the highest resolution version of the video. With that said, if you don't want
        a 5K, 8K version of the video, you can follow the keyword with the limit you want to set. For example, you
        can type in {c.bold}"max2160"{c.reset} to download the highest resolution of a video, but clip down anything
        above 2160p (e.g. 5K, 8K) back to 4k.
        
        Similarly, for the filename, you can type {c.bold}"/title"{c.reset} to use the video's title as the filename.
        Or, if you want to add a prefix and/or suffix, note that /title is just replaced with the video's title, but
        anything around it stays. So, you can type in {c.bold}"Downloaded video /title from <a YouTube channel>"{c.reset}
        if you wanted to, and everything would work!
        
        As a final note, adding that "p" (for pixels) at the end doesn't make a difference; you can type
        in {c.bold}"720"{c.reset} or {c.bold}"720p"{c.reset}. Either way, it'll be interpreted as 720p.
        
        --------------------  UI  ----------------------------------------
        There isn't as much to say about the UI, although there are a few tips.
        For one, not typing in anything when the option to choose a resolution comes
        up (i.e., immediately pressing enter) will default to the top result, the highest resolution.
        A second tip is that the "/title" feature mentioned above also works here. So, when you're asked
        to type in the filename, you can add /title at any point, and it'll be replaced with the video's title.
