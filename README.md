# UILibrary
This Python script hopefully makes handling inputs with the terminal easier, by doing a lot of the stuff for you. It isn't much, but it includes the highlight features of an improved input() that ensures that what's entered is of the correct type (e.g., integer), fancy formatting (some formatting), and a dictionary that saves and loads itself between running and stopping the script automagically! Note, it doesn't actually do really fancy stuff, like with Python's curses library, but I still occasionally find it helpful.

# PythonPoint
This is still a work in progress, but it's supposed to do something kind of similar to what Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides do, but with a txt file, and it exports images. It's nothing compared to the aforementioned software, but I think that it's cool; it supports text, images, and variables. As a note, I included some fonts with the Python file, all of the fonts are from Google Fonts, and should be fine to use. Most use the SIL Open Fonts License, although Roboto is distributed under the Apache License Version 2, so keep all of these in mind. If you want any more fonts, you should be able to add them into the Fonts folder, and the If statements shoudld take care of the rest. Note, the If statements were designed with Google Fonts's format in mind, so, you could try to follow the naming scheme of all the other fonts if necessary.
