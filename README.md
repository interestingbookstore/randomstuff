# YouTube Video Downloader
I occasionally wanted to download a YouTube video, but instead of using an application that someone else made, I decided to make my own! It utilizes [pytube](https://pypi.org/project/pytube), [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), and my very own UILibrary to find a video from a URL, download two temporary versions for the video and audio respectively (the highest quality versions that you watch are actually split into seperate video and audio files, who knew), then merge them together with FFmpeg. My python script allows you to select from YouTube's available resolution options (which all get the highest quality video for that resolution as well as the highest quality audio) or simply download the audio, at the highest quality of course. By popular request, this script is also intractable through terminal arguments ("URL", "Quality", "Filename"). And, you get a progress bar! (I've noticed that somehow, pytube finishes downloading videos a decent while before it claims to in its progress updates... which is odd...). Anyway, there you go, you can download videos!

# UILibrary
This Python script hopefully makes handling inputs with the terminal easier, by doing a lot of the stuff for you. It isn't much, but it includes the highlight features of an improved input() that ensures that what's entered is of the correct type (e.g., integer), fancy formatting (some formatting), and a dictionary that saves and loads itself between running and stopping the script automagically! Note, it doesn't actually do really fancy stuff, like with Python's curses library, but I still occasionally find it helpful.

# PythonPoint
This is still a work in progress, but it's supposed to do something kind of similar to what Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides do, but with a txt file, and it exports images. It's nothing compared to the aforementioned software, but I think that it's cool; it supports text, images, and variables. As a note, I included some fonts with the Python file, all of the fonts are from Google Fonts, and should be fine to use. Most use the SIL Open Fonts License, although Roboto is distributed under the Apache License Version 2, so keep all of these in mind. If you want any more fonts, you should be able to add them into the Fonts folder, and the If statements shoudld take care of the rest. Note, the If statements were designed with Google Fonts's format in mind, so, you could try to follow the naming scheme of all the other fonts if necessary.

# Image Cropping Tool
I thought that this was going to be a short, fun, and useful project. It was not short, and was quite difficult.... I though I could just use my PyBookEngine, but then I ended up having to add features I needed and update my older code (to make it run faster). Then, the tool itself ended up taking a lot of time to work on, and as the hours went by, I just decided to give up on some parts and implement them a bit more messily. It still works just fine, it's just messy. In terms of what it does, you drag in an image file, then make a selection to crop it, then press enter (technically return) to save it, which will be wherever is listed above in the options.

# PyBookEngine
This is something I worked on mostly some time ago, although occasionally I might update it a bit. The way it's supposed to work is you interact with it, and it interacts with PyGame. Why might you want it? Well, it simplifies many aspects of making something with PyGame, by doing a lot of the work for you. For instance, it handles updating the screen all by itself. No more do you need to deal with the reduced performance of `pygame.display.flip`, nor the complexity of `pygame.display.update(`With all of those rects`)`. It'll do all of that for you. Similarly, if you close the application, it closes! (Which is in fact something you need to add in) And, it supports many handy features, including automatic conversion between Pillow images, image paths, to the normal pygame surfaces. It even has a built in drop shadow feature! Now, with all of that said, I don't work on it too much anymore, meaning that some features may be a bit underdeveloped, with other things not having been implemented at all. Although, it does have the origin on the bottom left, so, that's cool...
