# UILibrary
This Python script hopefully makes handling inputs with the terminal easier, by doing a lot of the stuff for you. It isn't much, but it includes the highlight features of an improved input() that ensures that what's entered is of the correct type (e.g., integer), fancy formatting (some formatting), and a dictionary that saves and loads itself between running and stopping the script automagically! Note, it doesn't actually do really fancy stuff, like with Python's curses library, but I still occasionally find it helpful.

# PythonPoint
This is still a work in progress, but it's supposed to do something kind of similar to what Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides do, but with a txt file, and it exports images. It's nothing compared to the aforementioned software, but I think that it's cool; it supports text, images, and variables. As a note, I included some fonts with the Python file, all of the fonts are from Google Fonts, and should be fine to use. Most use the SIL Open Fonts License, although Roboto is distributed under the Apache License Version 2, so keep all of these in mind. If you want any more fonts, you should be able to add them into the Fonts folder, and the If statements shoudld take care of the rest. Note, the If statements were designed with Google Fonts's format in mind, so, you could try to follow the naming scheme of all the other fonts if necessary.

# PygameStuff
(I should really think of a better name, IDK)... anyway! I made this some time ago to make using Pygame easier. It's less so of something in addition to Pygame and more so something to use instead (although, it itself uses Pygame to work, this isn't by any means an alternative (and as the story with high level software goes it also can't do as much)). From what I remember it moves the origin to the bottom left, does rendering optimizing for you (in which it only updates the part of the window that needs to be updated, more or less), and has some other helpful features like a "scene" system in which you can have entirely seperate groups of stuff being drawn. So, you could have a menu scene, a game scene, and a game over scene, for example. As a note, there were a couple aspects of it that were rushed a bit (since I was tired and just wanted to make a game!) So, some things could be improved a bit, but for now I don't have a use for it very often, so it probably won't be recieving any more updates.

# YouTube Video Downloader
I occasionally wanted to download a YouTube video, but instead of using an application that someone else made, I decided to make my own! It utilizes [pytube](https://pypi.org/project/pytube), [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), and my very own UILibrary to find a video from a URL, download two temporary versions for the video and audio respectively (the highest quality versions that you watch are actually split into seperate video and audio files, who knew), then merge them together with FFmpeg. My python script allows you to select from YouTube's available resolution options (which all get the highest quality video for that resolution as well as the highest quality audio) or simply download the audio, at the highest quality of course. By popular request, this script is also intractable through terminal arguments ("URL", "Quality", "Filename"). And, you get a progress bar! (I've noticed that somehow, pytube finishes downloading videos a decent while before it claims to in its progress updates... which is odd...). Anyway, there you go, you can download videos!
